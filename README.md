<b>AngularJS Test</b>

Construct a single page doctor locator with a UI similar to:


https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/162BUEWsUw-rpaWe2eVRe9cdcCBJEb6LtQvu-4wfc0oQ/edit?usp=sharing . 

Search.json should be used in place of what an API would return.

<b>Requirements</b>

- UI should be similar to the link above

- When you click a doctor something should change on the map (zoom to doctor's pin, highlight pin, something)

- Final product should be a public github repo.

- We're looking for well constructed angular code. If you can't complete parts of the feature set, err on the side of code quality and test coverage rather than completion. Please do not spend more than 3 hours creating the app.
